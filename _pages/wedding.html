<section id="getting-there">
  <h1>How to get there</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Take the shuttle from Seattle</h4>
      <p>The shuttle will be leaving from <a href="www.google.com">some hotel</a>. This is the recommended option (both for the environment and our parking capacity!) and you won't have to deal with renting a car. If you're taking the shuttle, please make sure you selected this on the invitation or let Melissa or Chris know, since we'll be counting people.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Drive</h4>
      <p>If you're local or staying nearby, you'll probably be driving. Assuming a few people take the shuttle or carpool, we should have more than enough parking space for everyone. </p></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How not to get there</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Lyft/Uber</h4>
      <p>Aside from the fact that this would be pretty expensive coming from Seattle, coverage around the venue for rideshare services is not very good, and may leave you stranded after the wedding. If you need to go this route for whatever reason, we recommend pre-scheduling your pickup. </p></li>
    <li>
      <h4>Train</h4>
      <p>While a train to Stanwood does exist, this is not a recommend method of travel because 1) it arrives early in the morning, and the wedding is in the late afternoon, 2) there will be no train returning that night, leaving you stranded, and 3) it may be difficult to find a mode of transportation between the station and the wedding. </p></li></ul>
