  <h1>Registry?</h1>
  <p>We know that many of you will be traveling to our wedding, which is not cheap! We honestly are just happy to have you celebrate with us and don't expect you to get us a gift (seriously). We know that a few of you will insist on getting us something anyway, so we will update this site with a registry as we get closer to the date.</p>

<section class="short">
  <h1>Dress code?</h1>
  <p>Dress code is "dressy casual": basically, anything more formal than jeans and a t-shirt is probably fine; no need to wear a full-on suit or floor-length dress, although you are welcome to if that's what you're most comfortable in! The wedding and reception will take place outdoors on grass, so for your own comfort please leave your stiletto heels at home. Also, it is possible it may get chilly at night, so it is probably a good idea to bring a light jacket or coat. </p>
