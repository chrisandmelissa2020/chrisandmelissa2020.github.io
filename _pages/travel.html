  <h1>Transportation</h1>
  <p>For those who are flying, we recommend flying into Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA-TAC).</p>
  <p>For those staying in Seattle, we will be providing a shuttle to the wedding. This site will be updated with exact details closer to the date, but for planning purposes it will be leaving from the Seattle area at roughly 3ish. <!-- (details <a href="/wedding.html#getting-there">here</a>).-->
  </p>
  <p>
  While we recommend taking the shuttle, parking will also be available for those who have rented a car and choose to drive.

  <h1>Where to stay</h1>
  <!--<p>This time of the summer has Washington's best weather all year, so it's a popular time to visit. We recommend booking as soon as you can to make sure you have a place to stay! We've reserved a limited number of rooms at a discount rate at the Holiday Inn, which is also where the shuttle will leave from. </p>
  <p>-->
  <p>We recommend staying in Seattle and taking the opportunity to explore the city, which will also allow you to take advantage of the shuttle that we'll have running from Seattle. Details on hotels TBD; we will be reserving a hotel block somewhere in the Seattle area, which is also likely where the shuttle will leave from. </p>
  
  <p>There are also closer places to stay for those who would like to rent a car and drive further north, such as Marysville and Camino Island. Both of these areas have some number of hotels and AirBnBs.</p>
