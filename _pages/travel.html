  <h1>Getting there</h1>
  <p>The wedding will be in Warm Beach, WA.</p>
  <p>For those who are flying, we recommend flying into Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA-TAC).</p>
  <p>For those staying in Seattle, we will be providing a shuttle to the wedding. This site will be updated with exact details closer to the date, but for planning purposes it will be leaving from the Seattle area at roughly 3ish. <!-- (details <a href="/wedding.html#getting-there">here</a>).-->
  </p>
  <p>
  While we recommend taking the shuttle, parking will also be available for those who have rented a car and choose to drive.

  <h1>Where to stay</h1>
  <!--<p>This time of the summer has Washington's best weather all year, so it's a popular time to visit. We recommend booking as soon as you can to make sure you have a place to stay! We've reserved a limited number of rooms at a discount rate at the Holiday Inn, which is also where the shuttle will leave from. </p>
