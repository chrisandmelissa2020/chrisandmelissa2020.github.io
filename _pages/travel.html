  <h1>Transportation</h1>
  <p>For those who are flying, we recommend flying into Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA-TAC).</p>
  <p>For those staying in Seattle, we will be providing a shuttle to the wedding (details <a href="/wedding.html#getting-there">here</a>).</p>
  <p>
  While we recommend taking the shuttle, those who are staying closer to the wedding venue and have rented a car can also drive. Driving instructions <a href="wedding.html#where">here</a>.

  <h1>Where to stay</h1>
  <p>We've reserved a couple of hotel blocks in Seattle at a discounted rate! As we will be running a shuttle between Seattle and the venue, we recommend staying somewhere within Seattle, as there are many more things to see, eat, and explore!</p>
  <p>
  For those who would like to rent a car and stay closer to the wedding venue, there are additional options available (although we have not booked a hotel block:
  <ul>
    <li>Marysville</li>
    <li>Camino Island</li>
    <li>AirBnB</li>
  </ul>
